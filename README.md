# Sv√∏mme App

Android app for counting swim laps using camera motion detection and sound detection.

Features:
- Adjustable camera sensitivity and editable region of interest (ROI)
- Live camera preview with draggable and resizable ROI overlay
- Audio threshold detection
- Configurable lane length, turns-per-lap and debounce interval
- Light/Dark theme with high contrast
- Settings menu for all options with persistence

This project uses Jetpack Compose, CameraX and AudioRecord APIs. It is designed to be
extensible and well documented for future enhancements.

## Building

The repository omits the `gradle-wrapper.jar` binary. To build the project you will
need a local Gradle installation. Run the following to generate the wrapper and list
available tasks:

```bash
gradle wrapper
./gradlew tasks
```

The settings menu can be opened from the top-right settings icon on the main screen.
Here you can enable/disable camera or sound counting, adjust detection thresholds,
change the lane length, theme and ROI.
